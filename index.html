            <p id="paragraph">C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</p>
            <p id="paragraph">C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.</p>
            <p id="paragraph">C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
            <p id="paragraph">The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.</p>

            <h2 id="subtitle-2">Arduino and C++</h2>

            <p id="paragraph">Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. </p>
            <p id="paragraph-2">Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message -</p>
            <p id="paragraph-2">and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.</p>
            <p id="paragraph-2">You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.</p>
            <p id="paragraph-2">To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE),</p>
            <p id="paragraph-2">based on Processing.</p>
            <p id="paragraph-3">Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex</p>
            <p id="paragraph-3">scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up</p>
            <p id="paragraph-3">to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.</p>
            <p id="paragraph-4">The Arduino is programmed in C++ language, but the same language is a little adapted for attend the functionalities of Arduino.</p>
